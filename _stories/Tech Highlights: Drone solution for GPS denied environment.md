<blockquote><p><strong>Performance Rotors (Singapore)</strong><br></p><p><strong>“<em>We got to know ourselves better through Cap Vista’s due diligence process that allowed us to further capitalize on our unique capabilities through Cap Vista’s network. Defence related project specifications also served as a rigorous test for our proficiency that enabled us to further hone, develop and iterate our product suite towards current market needs”.</em></strong></p><p><em>Keith Ng, Co-Founder</em></p></blockquote><h4><strong>Not just a drone company but a supplier of drone technology</strong></h4><p>In the current world, any hobbyist or enthusiast could build a drone or obtain one commercially for personal recreation. Performance Rotors recognised early that a drone was not just a piece of “flying hardware” but a versatile platform upon which enabling technologies could be built on. These component technologies, in turn, could also be commercialized and sold as products. A team of various specializations comprising hardware engineers, software developers, robotics aficionados, computer vision experts and industry veterans was meticulously assembled to actualize this vision.</p><p>The founding team of Performance Rotors - Keith, Mark and Mervin first forged their friendship with the common passion for racing drones, which are flown without the guidance of GPS with high precision. This formed the pillar behind the company’s focus on GPS-denied and confined space inspection in the Oil &amp; Gas sector, one of the toughest environments to operate in.&nbsp;</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 90%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/PHOTO_2024_01_11_16_36_32.jpg"></div><p>While honing their craft, they expanded their product offering towards inspection activities (infrastructure &amp; maritime), often mitigating the need for workers to inspect dangerous and challenging confined environments. This evolution essentially rendered inspection processes safer, more efficient and cost effective.</p><p>Looking towards the future, the team innovates rapidly to strengthen their capabilities extending beyond visual inspection and data acquisition in challenging environments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Building drones to go where no man should</strong></h4><p>The founding team recognised the dual use potential of their technology and partnered MINDEF in developing drone capabilities. In close partnership with Performance Rotors, Cap Vista has guided the next phase of their tech roadmap to enhance their product suite and build the next growth stage.</p><h4><strong>Bringing tech from the workshop to the field</strong></h4><p>Working closely with defence partners allows Performance Rotors to understand their requirements and to fine-tune their product offerings to their needs before their technologies can be fielded. Cap Vista retains a close overview of the procurement process and ensures continuous alignment of expectations amongst the stakeholders. </p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%;" height="624" width="554.6772850562019" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ovSwPpbIqlIsZCojzbKDAmacmBtJfoq3jbuGbc7pCwb4aj8G2kR1wSQB4nXyzO2vP1LgsxcY59rXsWvjkMZAKoVdDh94ye7XraHzEqIaGrgL7sTX_vuOu65UySZhJmTeZNX7z29M7c3iDhQDCEi8qwI"></div><p><br></p>
