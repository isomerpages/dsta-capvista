<p><strong>Performance Rotors (Singapore)</strong><br></p><p>“<em>We got to know ourselves better through Cap Vista’s due diligence process that allowed us to further capitalize on our unique capabilities through Cap Vista’s network. Defence related project specifications also served as a rigorous test for our proficiency that enabled us to further hone, develop and iterate our product suite towards current market needs”.</em></p><p><em>Keith Ng, Co-Founder</em></p><p><strong>Not just a drone company but a supplier of drone technology</strong></p><p>In the current world, any hobbyist or enthusiast could build a drone or obtain one commercially for personal recreation. Performance Rotors recognised early that a drone was not just a piece of “flying hardware” but a versatile platform upon which enabling technologies could be built on. These component technologies, in turn, could also be commercialized and sold as products. A team of various specializations comprising hardware engineers, software developers, robotics aficionados, computer vision experts and industry veterans was meticulously assembled to actualize this vision.</p><p>Prior to the genesis of their venture, the founding team of Keith, Mark and Mervin first forged their friendship with the common passion for racing drones, which are flown without the guidance of GPS with high precision. This formed the pillar behind the company’s focus on GPS-denied and confined space inspection in the Oil &amp; Gas sector, one of the toughest environments to operate in.&nbsp;</p><p>While honing their craft, they expanded their product offering towards inspection activities (infrastructure &amp; maritime), often mitigating the need for workers to inspect dangerous and challenging confined environments. This evolution essentially rendered inspection processes safer, more efficient and cost effective.</p><p>Looking towards the future, the team innovates rapidly to strengthen their capabilities extending beyond visual inspection and data acquisition in challenging environments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>We build drones to go where no man should</strong></p><p>Sticking close to their mantra, the founding team recognised the dual use potential of their technology and partnered MINDEF in developing drone capabilities. In close partnership with them, Cap Vista has guided the next phase of their tech roadmap to enhance their product suite and build the next growth stage.</p><p><strong>Bringing tech from the workshop to the battlefield</strong></p><p>Working closely with key entities such as the Defence Science Organisation (DSO) and Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) allows Performance Rotors to understand their requirements and to fine-tune their product offerings to their needs. Cap Vista retains a close overview of the procurement process and ensures continuous alignment of expectations amongst the stakeholders. One recent example was their participation in the annual Exercise Forging Sabre held in Idaho, USA that sought to showcase the multi-domain warfighting capabilities of the SAF - giving added dimension to the sense and strike loops across domains.</p><p><strong>Collaborating on the journey ahead</strong></p><p>The acquisition of Performance Rotors by Xtend in 2023 opens new possibilities to broaden and enrich the combined product offering. This also sparks the imagination of their customers as they would have access to drones with enhanced capabilities thereby ensuring that Performance Rotors will secure its place as the vendor of choice in the confined inspection space.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%;" height="624" width="554.6772850562019" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ovSwPpbIqlIsZCojzbKDAmacmBtJfoq3jbuGbc7pCwb4aj8G2kR1wSQB4nXyzO2vP1LgsxcY59rXsWvjkMZAKoVdDh94ye7XraHzEqIaGrgL7sTX_vuOu65UySZhJmTeZNX7z29M7c3iDhQDCEi8qwI"></div><p><br></p>
