<p><strong>“<em>We had the opportunity to introduce our unique capabilities to the different parties through Cap Vista's network. These valuable collaboration opportunities also served as a rigorous test for our technology, enabling us to further hone, develop and iterate our product suite towards current market needs”.</em></strong>

<h4><strong>Not just any drone company but a supplier of drone technology</strong></h4>
<p>In the current world, any hobbyist or enthusiast could build a drone or
obtain one commercially for recreation. Performance Rotors recognised early
that a drone was not just a piece of “flying hardware” but a versatile
platform upon which enabling technologies could be built on. These component
technologies, in turn, could also be commercialized and sold as products.
A team of various specializations comprising hardware engineers, software
developers, robotics aficionados, computer vision experts and industry
veterans was meticulously assembled to realise this vision.</p>
<p>The founding team of Performance Rotors - Keith, Mark and Mervin first
forged their friendship with the common passion for racing drones, which
are flown without the guidance of GPS with high precision. This formed
the pillar behind the company’s focus on GPS-denied and confined space
inspection in the Oil &amp; Gas sector, one of the toughest environments
to operate in.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>Building drones to go where no man should</strong></h4>
<p>While honing their craft, they expanded their product offering towards
inspection activities (infrastructure &amp; maritime), often mitigating
the need for workers to inspect dangerous and challenging confined environments.
This evolution essentially rendered inspection processes safer, more efficient
and cost effective.</p>
<p>Looking towards the future, the team innovates rapidly to strengthen their
capabilities extending beyond visual inspection and data acquisition in
challenging environments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
