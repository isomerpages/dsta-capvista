<blockquote><p><strong>“<em>We had the opportunity to introduce our unique capabilities to the different defence stakeholders through Cap Vista's network. These valuable collaboration opportunities also served as a rigorous test for our technology, enabling us to further hone, develop and iterate our product suite towards current market needs”.</em></strong></p><p><em>Keith Ng, Co-Founder, Performance Rotors (Singapore)</em></p></blockquote><h4><strong>Not just any drone company but a supplier of drone technology</strong></h4><p>In the current world, any hobbyist or enthusiast could build a drone or obtain one commercially for recreation. Performance Rotors recognised early that a drone was not just a piece of “flying hardware” but a versatile platform upon which enabling technologies could be built on. These component technologies, in turn, could also be commercialized and sold as products. A team of various specializations comprising hardware engineers, software developers, robotics aficionados, computer vision experts and industry veterans was meticulously assembled to realise this vision.</p><p>The founding team of Performance Rotors - Keith, Mark and Mervin first forged their friendship with the common passion for racing drones, which are flown without the guidance of GPS with high precision. This formed the pillar behind the company’s focus on GPS-denied and confined space inspection in the Oil &amp; Gas sector, one of the toughest environments to operate in.&nbsp;</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 90%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/PHOTO_2024_01_11_16_36_32.jpg"></div><p><em>Performance Rotors Founding Team: Keith (Center), Mervin (Left) and Mark (Right)</em></p><h4><strong>Building drones to go where no man should</strong></h4><p>While honing their craft, they expanded their product offering towards inspection activities (infrastructure &amp; maritime), often mitigating the need for workers to inspect dangerous and challenging confined environments. This evolution essentially rendered inspection processes safer, more efficient and cost effective.</p><p>Looking towards the future, the team innovates rapidly to strengthen their capabilities extending beyond visual inspection and data acquisition in challenging environments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%;" height="624" width="554.6772850562019" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ovSwPpbIqlIsZCojzbKDAmacmBtJfoq3jbuGbc7pCwb4aj8G2kR1wSQB4nXyzO2vP1LgsxcY59rXsWvjkMZAKoVdDh94ye7XraHzEqIaGrgL7sTX_vuOu65UySZhJmTeZNX7z29M7c3iDhQDCEi8qwI"></div><p><em>Enabling Safe Inspections in the Maritime, Civil and Oil and Gas Industry</em></p><h4><strong>Partnering defence ecosystem players</strong></h4><p>The founding team recognised the dual use potential of their technology and partnered with our defence stakeholders in developing drone capabilities. In close partnership with Performance Rotors, Cap Vista guided their tech roadmap to enhance their product suite to build the next growth stage. Working closely with defence partners allows Performance Rotors to understand their requirements and to fine-tune their product offerings to their needs before fielding their technology. Through Cap Vista's efforts to bridge the gap between startups and defence stakeholders, innovative dual-use startups like Performance Rotors are able to accelerate their collaboration with our defence ecosystem.</p><p></p><p><br></p>
