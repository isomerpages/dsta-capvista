<p><strong>Bifrost</strong> is developing an automated solution for generating both 2D and 3D synthetic labeled datasets and environments for AI and machine learning training. Bifrost was founded by two Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) graduates - Charles Wong (CEO) and Aravind Kandiah (CTO) in 2019 before the hype of generative AI. Bifrost caught the attention of the Cap Vista team during a pitching session in SUTD and subsequently invested in their company during their SEED round.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p></p>
