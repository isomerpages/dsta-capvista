<p><strong>Bifrost AI&nbsp;(Singapore)</strong><br><br>“<strong><em>Through working with Cap Vista and DSTA, Bifrost received strategic guidance and valuable experience in deploying our products in the defence environment, allowing us to extend our advanced technology to vital government and defense projects globally.</em></strong>”</p><p>Charles Wong, CEO, Bifrost</p><p>Bifrost is building the future of Generative 3D, allowing creatives and developers to build 3D worlds at scale. Bifrost has empowered some of the world’s most demanding organizations to do the impossible like landing spacecraft on Mars, or catching pirates at sea.</p><p>Bifrost was founded in 2020 by Singapore University of Technology and Design alumni Charles Wong (CEO) and Aravind Kandiah (CTO), and has rapidly become a pioneer in the field of Generative 3D. Recognized early by Cap Vista during a pitch session at SUTD, Bifrost secured investment in its pre-seed round, setting the stage for groundbreaking advancements in AI technology.</p><p>Bifrost’s unique approach in creating scalable, photorealistic 3D worlds is reshaping industries. The company specializes in generating synthetic datasets that are diverse, customizable, and immediately available, enabling AI teams to develop robust models with unprecedented speed and accuracy. This innovative method drastically reduces the time, cost, and resources traditionally required for collecting and annotating high-quality training data. Bifrost's advanced technology has been instrumental in simulations for Mars spacecraft landings and maritime piracy interception, showcasing its versatile applications.&nbsp;</p><p>Supported and facilitated by Cap Vista, Bifrost’s collaboration with global government partners is pushing the boundaries of AI innovation. By providing novel, disruptive solutions, Bifrost addresses critical national security challenges and continues to set new standards in Generative 3D technology.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="margin-left:0px;margin-top:0px;" height="308" width="624" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/XVa2Un5ycP_uMDqW26qch0vyo7AdQDBWOVydoxH44PJUszNLfcvIq5pltnG3Kh7Anuw7Bg2N5Q39zQn-x9cT93wCVQEstbla5VvBov4kGuXGgv37cEHBip5rN3NaOaFK7ulc0oZdf0kAodvM1LIn__0"></div><p><strong>Accelerating AI Development and Reducing Costs Through Synthetic Data</strong></p><p>Bifrost AI scalable, photorealistic 3D worlds are used for diverse applications, ranging from simulating spacecraft landings on Mars to maritime piracy interception and object detection. What sets Bifrost apart is its ability to empower AI teams to build robust models without the traditional struggle of finding high-quality labeled training data at scale. The current process of collecting and annotating such datasets from the physical world requires substantial infrastructure, large teams, millions of dollars and takes years to complete.</p><p>Bifrost builds virtual worlds and enables teams to generate synthetic datasets that are diverse, highly-customizable and rare on-demand so that they can train models with higher accuracy within minutes, instead of months or years.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="margin-left:0px;margin-top:0px;" height="338" width="600" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/CpHXbeS9dzmRseYqdllkuDBA3bvPeeFuoBJL2klEX7BUSuKTGpvV8BWxbj-GMGmZ_RlPFMIG6yPTKS79Hjp0NO1vamDENk-n58-aygdTy8Dz3P_xpBqiPzG-wRPd_hjHbbRfS_qkQ84yM1Y3NqBoVcQ"></div><p><strong>Expanding into the defence and intelligence market globally</strong></p><p>Cap Vista worked closely with Bifrost through our introduction and facilitation to&nbsp;various defence and government entities, as well as our defence partners. Bifrost CEO, Charles Wong remarks that “<strong><em>through working with Cap Vista and DSTA, Bifrost received strategic guidance and valuable experience in deploying our products in the defence environment, allowing us to extend our advanced technology to vital government and defence projects globally.</em></strong>” Bifrost’s partnership pushes the boundaries of AI innovation and introduces novel and disruptive solutions to address our national security challenges. Through collaborating with our defence partners and other organizations such as NASA JPL, the US Air Force, US SOUTHCOM, Bifrost extends and hones its advanced technology through vital government and defence projects.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="margin-left:0px;margin-top:0px;" height="315" width="559" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/HeQRxNcV3faoTsnR_CqjoReAB2ohYVob4C0Hbs8n8poDILEU6ZsmGVxwK8WoGH2ZnAvQ0F92_nLt047EJLnapKja25nkVHAGD5TPUTZgq6CdH7QWbNqW4MoIvIYmbsLtQLLlPQUNyR5QFhwfA7dHGYw"></div><h3><br></h3><p></p>
