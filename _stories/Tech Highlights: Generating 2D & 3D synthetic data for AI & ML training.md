<h4><strong>Building 3D Worlds at Scale</strong></h4>
<p>Bifrost is building the future of Generative 3D, allowing creatives and
developers to build 3D worlds at scale. Bifrost has empowered some of the
world’s most demanding organizations to do the impossible like landing
spacecraft on Mars, or catching pirates at sea.</p>
<p>Bifrost was founded in 2020 by Singapore University of Technology and
Design alumni Charles Wong (CEO) and Aravind Kandiah (CTO), and has rapidly
become a pioneer in the field of Generative 3D. Recognized early by Cap
Vista during a pitch session at SUTD, Bifrost secured investment in its
pre-seed round, setting the stage for groundbreaking advancements in AI
technology.</p>

<h4><strong>Accelerating AI Development Through Synthetic Data</strong></h4>
<p>Bifrost’s unique approach in creating scalable, photorealistic 3D worlds
is reshaping industries. The company specializes in generating synthetic
datasets that are diverse, customizable, and immediately available, enabling
AI teams to develop robust models with unprecedented speed and accuracy.
This innovative method drastically reduces the time, cost, and resources
traditionally required for collecting and annotating high-quality training
data. Bifrost's advanced technology has been instrumental in simulations
for Mars spacecraft landings and maritime piracy interception, showcasing
its versatile applications.&nbsp;</p>
