<p><strong>Bifrost AI&nbsp;(Singapore)</strong><br><br></p><p>Bifrost is developing an automated solution for generating both 2D and 3D synthetic labeled datasets and environments for AI and machine learning training. Bifrost was founded by two Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) graduates - Charles Wong (CEO) and Aravind Kandiah (CTO) in 2019 before the hype of generative AI. Bifrost caught the attention of the Cap Vista team during a pitching session in SUTD and subsequently invested in their company during their SEED round.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="margin-left:0px;margin-top:0px;" height="308" width="624" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/XVa2Un5ycP_uMDqW26qch0vyo7AdQDBWOVydoxH44PJUszNLfcvIq5pltnG3Kh7Anuw7Bg2N5Q39zQn-x9cT93wCVQEstbla5VvBov4kGuXGgv37cEHBip5rN3NaOaFK7ulc0oZdf0kAodvM1LIn__0"></div><p><br><strong>Accelerating AI Development and Reducing Costs Through Synthetic Data</strong></p><p>Bifrost AI scalable, photorealistic 3D worlds are used for diverse applications, ranging from simulating spacecraft landings on Mars to maritime piracy interception and object detection. What sets Bifrost apart is its ability to empower AI teams to build robust models without the traditional struggle of finding high-quality labeled training data at scale. The current process of collecting and annotating such datasets from the physical world requires substantial infrastructure, large teams, millions of dollars and takes years to complete.</p><p>Bifrost builds virtual worlds and enables teams to generate synthetic datasets that are diverse, highly-customizable and rare on-demand so that they can train models with higher accuracy within minutes, instead of months or years.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="margin-left:0px;margin-top:0px;" height="338" width="600" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/CpHXbeS9dzmRseYqdllkuDBA3bvPeeFuoBJL2klEX7BUSuKTGpvV8BWxbj-GMGmZ_RlPFMIG6yPTKS79Hjp0NO1vamDENk-n58-aygdTy8Dz3P_xpBqiPzG-wRPd_hjHbbRfS_qkQ84yM1Y3NqBoVcQ"></div><p><strong>Expanding into the defence and intelligence market globally</strong></p><p>Cap Vista worked closely with Bifrost through our introduction and facilitation to&nbsp; various defence and government entities, as well as our defence partners. Bifrost CEO, Charles&nbsp; Wong remarks that “<strong><em>through working with Cap Vista and DSTA, Bifrost received strategic guidance and valuable experience in deploying our products in the defence environment, allowing us to extend our advanced technology to vital government and defence projects globally.</em></strong>” Bifrost’s partnership pushes the boundaries of AI innovation and introduces novel and disruptive solutions to address our national security challenges. Through collaborating with our defence partners and other organizations such as NASA JPL, the US Air Force, US SOUTHCOM, Bifrost extends and hones its advanced technology through vital government and defence projects</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="margin-left:0px;margin-top:0px;" height="315" width="559" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/HeQRxNcV3faoTsnR_CqjoReAB2ohYVob4C0Hbs8n8poDILEU6ZsmGVxwK8WoGH2ZnAvQ0F92_nLt047EJLnapKja25nkVHAGD5TPUTZgq6CdH7QWbNqW4MoIvIYmbsLtQLLlPQUNyR5QFhwfA7dHGYw"></div><h3><br></h3><p></p>
